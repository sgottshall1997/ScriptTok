I need you to enhance the content history system in my TikTok Viral Product Generator app to better track viral scores and user feedback. Please make these specific updates:

1. Replace Debug Rating Section with Viral Score Display:

In /client/src/pages/EnhancedContentHistory.tsx, find and remove the debug rating section that shows:
ðŸ”§ RATING DEBUG: entry.id=db_1178...
âœ… RATING ENABLED: databaseId = 1178
Replace this entire debug section with a clean viral score display that shows:
The viral score from the generation (if available)
Color-coded scoring (green for 80+, yellow for 60-79, red for <60)
Score breakdown by category (hook strength, engagement, clarity, length, trending)
2. Add User Rating and Comments Section:

Below the viral score display, add a new user feedback section with:
Star rating system (1-5 stars) for users to rate the generated content
Text area for user comments/feedback about the content quality
Save/update functionality to store user ratings in the database
Display existing user ratings if they exist
3. Update Content Generation to Save Viral Scores:

Ensure that when content is generated in /server/api/generateContent.ts, the viral score data is properly saved to the content history database
The viral score should include all breakdown components (hookStrength, engagement, clarity, length, trending)
Make sure the viral score data is accessible when displaying content history
4. Database Schema Updates (if needed):

Verify that the content history table can store viral score data
Add columns for user rating (1-5 integer) and user comments (text) if they don't exist
Ensure proper indexing for performance
5. UI/UX Improvements:

Make the viral score section visually appealing with progress bars or circular progress indicators
Use consistent styling with the existing TikTok theme (black, pink, purple colors)
Add tooltips explaining what each viral score component measures
Include timestamp for when user ratings were added
Key Requirements:

Remove all debug text and make the interface clean and user-friendly
Viral scores should be prominently displayed and easy to understand
User rating system should be intuitive (star ratings + comments)
Data persistence for both viral scores and user feedback
Maintain existing functionality while adding these enhancements
Use existing UI components and styling patterns from the app
Testing Expectations:

Generate new content and verify viral scores appear in content history
Test user rating functionality (add, update, display ratings)
Ensure all data is properly saved and retrieved from the database
Verify the interface is clean and free of debug information
Please implement these changes while maintaining the existing content history functionality and ensuring all new features integrate seamlessly with the current TikTok Viral Product Generator workflow."

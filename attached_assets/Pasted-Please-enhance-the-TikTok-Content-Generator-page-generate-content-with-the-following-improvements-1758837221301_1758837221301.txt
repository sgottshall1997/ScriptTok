Please enhance the TikTok Content Generator page (/generate-content) with the following improvements:
1. **Usage Statistics Section at Top:**
   Add a statistics card at the very top of the page showing:
   - Total content generations (all time)
   - Total generations this month
   - Total generations today
   - Most popular template used
   - Most popular niche used
   - Current streak (days with at least 1 generation)
   
   Style this as a horizontal card with 6 columns, each showing an icon, number, and label. Use a gradient background and make it visually appealing.
2. **Multi-Template Selection Enhancement:**
   Replace the current single template selector with a multi-select system:
   - Allow users to select multiple templates at once using checkboxes or toggle buttons
   - Highlight selected templates with a distinct color/border (blue accent)
   - Show a count of selected templates (e.g., "3 templates selected")
   - When no templates are selected, show a validation message
   - Maintain the current TemplateSelector component but modify it to support multiple selections
   - Add a "Select All" and "Clear All" button for convenience
3. **Output Calculation Display at Bottom:**
   Add a summary section at the bottom (before the generate button) that shows:
   - Total variations that will be generated
   - Calculation breakdown (e.g., "2 tones × 3 templates × 1 AI model = 6 unique content pieces")
   - Estimated generation time based on the number of outputs
   - Display this in a card similar to the attached image with an icon and clear text
   - Update this calculation dynamically as users change their selections
4. **Enhanced Generation Logic:**
   Modify the content generation to handle multiple templates:
   - Generate content for each selected template
   - Display results in organized sections by template type
   - Allow users to copy individual template results
   - Show progress indicator during multi-template generation
5. **UI/UX Improvements:**
   - Add loading states for statistics
   - Include tooltips explaining what each statistic means
   - Make the output calculation more prominent with better visual hierarchy
   - Add success animations when templates are selected/deselected
Please ensure all changes integrate seamlessly with the existing codebase structure, maintain the current styling patterns, and preserve the AI model selection functionality. The statistics should pull from the existing content history system, and the multi-template generation should work with both Claude and ChatGPT models.
Focus on making the interface more informative and user-friendly while maintaining the current TikTok-focused functionality.

The key insight:
Uses flat, simple grids ‚Äî each dropdown is 4‚Äì6 concise cards (not subdivided groups or nested sections).

Each card = icon + title + 1-sentence description.

That pattern works best for your app too ‚Äî since ScriptTok‚Äôs tools are fast, visual, and modular.

So below is a revised, Pictory-style version that matches your product scope and visual rhythm while keeping ‚Äúdual studios‚Äù and ‚ÄúAI power‚Äù front-and-center.

TASK: Fix Template Documentation Accuracy - Proven Viral Templates Feature & Template Library Tool

CRITICAL CONTEXT:
The "Proven Viral Templates" feature page and "Template Library" tool page contain INCORRECT information about templates that don't exist in the actual codebase. We need to make these pages 100% factually accurate based on the real templates defined in `shared/templateMetadata.ts`.

CURRENT PROBLEMS:
1. Both pages list fictional templates (Product Showcase, Before/After, Tutorial, Review, Unboxing, etc.) that don't exist
2. "Proven Viral Templates" should correctly list the templates
3. Template library page
4. . "Template Library" page is good  
5 . Template counts and categories are incorrect
6.  "Top performing templates" section shows fake metrics and non-existent templates

ACTUAL TEMPLATES IN PHEME (from shared/templateMetadata.ts):

VIRAL TEMPLATES (7 total - no product needed):
1. Viral Hooks - Generates 10 scroll-stopping hooks (3-8 words each)
2. Short Script (15-30s) - Hook/Build/Payoff/Button structure (70-120 words)
3. Storytime - Narrative story script (90-150 words, single paragraph)
4. Duet/Reaction - Reaction script outline (≤50 words total)
5. Listicle - Top 3-5 format with titles/explanations (90-140 words)
6. Challenge - TikTok challenge with steps and variations
7. Caption + Hashtags - 3 caption options + 2 hashtag sets (15-20 hashtags total)

AFFILIATE TEMPLATES (13 total - product-focused):
1. Universal Short Video - 5-paragraph video script (70-140 words, Hook/Features/Problem-Solution/Audience/CTA)
2. Short Video - Niche Specific built scripts - Specialized by niche (beauty, tech, fashion, etc.) (70-140 words) - 7 total scripts (1 per niche)
3. Product Comparison - Full comparison guide (600-800 words with title, summary, comparison points, verdict)
4. Routine Kit - Step-by-step routine guide (500-700 words with schedule, shopping list, pro tips)
5. SEO Blog - Search-optimized blog post (1000+ words with H2/H3 structure, FAQ section)
6. Affiliate Email - Email blurb (100-150 words max with subject lines, P.S. line)
7. Influencer Caption - Social media caption (100-200 words, 4 paragraphs, 15-20 hashtags, NO emojis)

3. UPDATE "Template Categories" tabs:
   - By Mode: Viral (13) | Affiliate (7)
   - Remove "By Niche" and "By Duration" tabs (inaccurate data)

4. ADD "Expected Output" examples for each template showing exactly what users will receive


Changes needed:
1. REMOVE these sections entirely:
   - "Template Categories" section with tabs (By Type, By Platform, By Niche, By Duration)
   - "Top Performing Templates" section with fake metrics
   - Any hardcoded template lists (templatesByType, templatesByPlatform, templatesByNiche, templatesByDuration, allTemplates, topPerformers)

2. REPLACE with benefits-focused content:
   - Keep "Why Use Templates?" section (already good)
   - Keep "What You Get" section (already good)
   - Keep "Real-World Use Cases" section (already good)
   - In template library, Add NEW section: "How Templates Work" explaining:
     * Viral templates (no product needed) vs Affiliate templates (product-focused)
     * Template structure (hooks, variables, AI adaptation)
     * Customization and saving process

3. UPDATE all CTAs to point to Template Library tool:
   - "Browse Template Library" → navigate to /tools/template-library

4. VERIFY no fictional template names appear anywhere on the page

FILE 2: client/src/pages/tools/TemplateLibraryTool.tsx  

Changes needed:
1. REMOVE all fictional template references:
   - Delete: nicheTemplates array (shows wrong counts)
   - Delete: contentTypes array (Product Showcase, Before/After, Trending Hook, Tutorial, Review, Unboxing)
   - Delete: topPerformers array (shows fake metrics)
   - Delete: Any hardcoded template counts that don't match reality


6. REMOVE "Top Performing Templates" section or replace with "Getting Started" recommendations (no fake metrics)

VALIDATION CHECKLIST:
□ No fictional template names appear anywhere (Product Showcase, Before/After, Tutorial, Review, Unboxing, etc.)
□ Template counts match reality: 7 viral + 7 affiliate = 14 total templates
□ Proven Viral Templates page focuses on BENEFITS only, no template listings
□ Template Library is the ONLY place showing actual template listings
□ Each template has accurate description of its output format
□ All CTAs correctly route to Template Library tool (/tools/template-library)
□ Template metadata imported from shared/templateMetadata.ts (source of truth)
□ No hardcoded template data that could become outdated

TESTING REQUIREMENTS:
1. Navigate to /features/proven-viral-templates - verify NO template listings appear, only benefits
2. Navigate to /tools/template-library - verify ALL 14 templates listed with accurate descriptions
3. Click any "Browse Templates" CTA - verify it navigates to /tools/template-library
4. Check template counts - verify shows 7 viral, 7 affiliate everywhere
5. Review template descriptions - verify they match what promptFactory.ts actually generates

DO NOT:
- Create new templates that don't exist in the codebase
- Show template counts that don't match reality
- Include fake performance metrics or stats
- Duplicate template listings between feature page and tool page
- Hardcode template data instead of importing from templateMetadata.ts

DELIVER:
1. Updated ProvenViralTemplatesFeature.tsx (benefits-focused, no template listings)
2. Updated TemplateLibraryTool.tsx (accurate template catalog with real output descriptions)
3. Summary of changes explaining how the two pages now work together correctly

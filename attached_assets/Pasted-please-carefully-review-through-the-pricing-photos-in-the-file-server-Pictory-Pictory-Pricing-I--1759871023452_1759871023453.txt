please carefully review through the pricing photos in the file  (server/Pictory/Pictory Pricing). I want to build a  pricing page (using the pricing tab in the marketing nav bar).  (Do not code anything yourself). Below is my pricing strategy. We will update the pricing logic in the actual app later, but for now, lets build this page

🔧 Updated Tier Strategy (Final Recommended)

🟡 Starter – $7/mo ($5/mo annual)

Philosophy: “Enough to taste the magic, not enough to live in it.”

Generation Limits
	•	GPT-4 Generations: 15/month
	•	Claude Generations: 10/month
	•	Trend Fetcher Calls: 10/month
	•	Viral Score Analysis: Basic single-AI version (GPT-4 only)

Feature Access

✅ 3 templates per category (hooks, storytelling, educational only)
✅ 3 niches unlocked (beauty, tech, fashion)
✅ Last 10 content items in history
✅ Viral Score preview (shows number only, no detailed breakdown)
❌ No bulk generation
❌ No content export
❌ No trend forecasting
❌ No custom prompts
❌ No API access

🧠 Upgrade Trigger: “You’ll immediately hit your generation cap and want full trend forecasting + viral score insights.”

💬 Why $5/$7 works:
	•	Filters non-serious users but keeps low entry friction.
	•	Generates meaningful recurring revenue even from testers.
	•	Aligns with Pictory’s psychological $19 baseline but positions you as the “lightweight, faster, cheaper” alternative.

Key Strategic Gates (What Drives Upgrades)
Free → Creator ($15/mo)
Pain Point: Running out of generations fast
* Limits are too tight for serious testing (5 GPT + 3 Claude)
* Can't export content history
* Missing trend forecasting = shooting in the dark
Creator → Pro ($35/mo)
Pain Point: Manual work is too slow
* No bulk generation = wasting hours
* Can't access affiliate studio = missing revenue opportunities
* Limited trend calls = can't research enough
* No custom prompts = repetitive work
Pro → Agency ($69/mo)
Pain Point: Team collaboration & scale
* No team seats = paying $35/person
* No API = can't automate workflows
* No brand templates = recreating client voices every time
* No analytics dashboard = can't prove ROI to clients





Analyze the structure of the pictory pricing panes and match my my new pricing to these structures. Please also ask the replit agent to carefully review these files (server/Pictory/Pictory Pricing) for an extra eye.

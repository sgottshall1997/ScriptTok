You are tasked with simplifying the TikTok Generator page in the GlowBot application. Please make these specific changes to streamline it as a TikTok-only content generator:
TASK 1: Remove Affiliate Link Generator Section
- In GenerateContent.tsx, remove the entire "Affiliate Link Generator" section from the Product & Affiliate Setup card
- Remove all affiliate-related state variables: productUrl, affiliateNetwork, affiliateId, smartRedirectUrl
- Remove the generateRedirectUrl function and all affiliate link generation logic
- Remove affiliate-related UI components including network selector, affiliate ID input, and product URL input
- Remove the affiliate link preview display section
- Keep only the Product Name and Niche fields in the Product & Affiliate Setup card
TASK 2: Remove Platform Selection (TikTok Only)
- Remove the platform selector UI from the Content Setup card
- Remove selectedPlatforms state and hardcode it to ['tiktok'] only
- Remove the togglePlatform function and platforms array
- Remove all platform-specific caption generation except TikTok
- In the generated content output, show only the TikTok caption, remove Instagram, YouTube, and other platform captions
- Update the showPlatformCaptions section to only display TikTok content
- Remove the platform-specific styling and buttons for other platforms
TASK 3: Remove Scheduler Section
- Remove the Schedule field and scheduleTime state from the Content Setup card
- Remove all scheduling-related UI components and dropdowns
- Remove any schedule-related logic in the handleGenerateContent function
- This should be a simple generator that creates content immediately, not a scheduler
TASK 4: Update UI Labels and Descriptions
- Change page title from "Viral Content Factory" to "TikTok Content Generator"
- Update the description to "Generate viral TikTok content in under 60 seconds"
- Update button text from "Generate Viral Content (60s)" to "Generate TikTok Content"
- Remove any references to "multi-platform" or "cross-platform" in the UI
- Update the generated content card title to "Generated TikTok Content"
TASK 5: Clean Up Related Functions
- Simplify generatePlatformCaption to only handle TikTok
- Remove platform-specific logic from generatePlatformCaptionForSaving
- Update ContentHistoryManager.saveEntry to only save TikTok-specific data
- Remove unused platform constants and configurations
EXPECTED RESULT:
The GenerateContent page should be a clean, focused TikTok content generator with:
- Product name and niche selection only
- Template type and tone selection
- TikTok-specific content generation
- Single TikTok caption output
- No affiliate link generation
- No platform selection
- No scheduling options
- Immediate content generation only
Please ensure all removed functionality is cleanly eliminated without breaking the core TikTok content generation workflow.

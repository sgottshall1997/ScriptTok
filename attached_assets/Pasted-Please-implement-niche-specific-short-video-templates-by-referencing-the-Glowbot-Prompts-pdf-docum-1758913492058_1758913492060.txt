Please implement niche-specific short video templates by referencing the "Glowbot Prompts.pdf" document in the attached_assets folder. Currently, only Fashion and Fitness niches have detailed short video implementations, while Beauty, Tech, Food, Travel, and Pet niches fall back to generic universal templates.

EXPECTED OUTCOME: After implementation, selecting "Beauty + Short Video" should generate content using beauty-specific prompts about skincare ingredients, application methods, skin types, etc., rather than generic product review language. Please make sure this is done for all 7 niches when selecting short video. 


TASK REQUIREMENTS:
1. Review the PDF Document: Examine the attached_assets/Glowbot Prompts.pdf to understand the specific prompt structures for each niche's short video template.
2. Implement Missing Niche Templates: Replace the stub functions in server/services/promptFactory.ts for the following niches:
    * generateBeautyShortVideo()
    * generateTechShortVideo()
    * generateFoodShortVideo()
    * generateTravelShortVideo()
    * generatePetShortVideo()
3. Template Structure Requirements: Each niche-specific function should follow the same detailed structure as the existing Fashion and Fitness templates, including:
    * Attention-grabbing hooks (with multiple variations)
    * Niche-specific product details and features
    * Relevant use cases and benefits
    * Target audience identification
    * Strong call-to-action options
    * Proper word count targets (100-170 words for 30-60 seconds)
4. Preserve Existing Architecture:
    * Keep the TEMPLATE_REGISTRY structure intact
    * Maintain the viral template enhancement functionality
    * Don't break the existing Fashion and Fitness implementations
    * Ensure universal fallback still works for other template types
5. Quality Standards:
    * Each niche should have unique, industry-specific language
    * Include relevant product attributes for each niche (e.g., ingredients for beauty, specs for tech, etc.)
    * Provide multiple hook variations and CTA options to avoid repetition
    * Follow the exact tone and style guidelines from the PDF
6. Testing Consideration: Ensure that when a user selects any niche + "Short Video" template, they get the niche-appropriate detailed template instead of the generic universal one.

Please implement this systematically, referring directly to the PDF for each niche's specific requirements and terminology.

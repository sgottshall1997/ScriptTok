⚙️ Global Prompt Improvements

✅ 1. Add a Universal Output Audit Footer

Add this to every prompt:

“Before returning, verify:
	•	All required sections present
	•	Word count within limits
	•	No emojis or bracketed notes
	•	Hashtags/disclosures included (if required).
If any check fails, silently fix and re-output.”

⸻

✅ 2. Add a Post-Processor Validator in Code

Implement a simple function that:
	•	Strips bracketed notes (e.g., [Note:], [Performance Notes:])
	•	Removes emojis (unless allowed)
	•	Checks word counts
	•	Confirms required sections exist
	•	Ensures hashtags count and format
	•	Regenerates automatically if invalid

⸻

✅ 3. Fix Beauty Short Video Routing
	•	Either rename the beauty short_video prompt to routine_kit
	•	Or replace it with a real short-form video prompt consistent with your other niches.

Would you like me to turn this checklist into a developer-ready JSON validation guide (so you can embed it into your Replit backend)? It would automatically validate and re-generate outputs that miss these conditions.

Replit Agent Prompt: Adapt BuildAIde Authentication for ScriptTok
Please review and update all files in the AuthForFutureIntegration folder to be ScriptTok-ready. These files are currently configured for a BuildAIde application and need comprehensive updates for ScriptTok branding, functionality, and integration preparation. Do NOT integrate these files into the main app yet - just prepare them for future integration.

Required Changes:
1. Branding & Terminology Updates
Replace all "BuildAIde" references with "ScriptTok"
Update all "renovation" and "construction" related copy to content creation/TikTok script generation terminology
Change taglines from renovation/building themes to viral content/AI scriptwriting themes
Update welcome messages and descriptions to reflect ScriptTok's purpose (AI-powered TikTok script generation)
2. Visual & Design Updates
Replace BuildAIde logo references (logoImage) with ScriptTok branding
Update the auth layout background image (rectangle43Image) to reflect content creation/social media theme instead of construction
Change color scheme from yellow accent (#F6E001) to ScriptTok's purple/pink gradient theme
Update the royal blue (royalBlue) references to match ScriptTok's brand colors (purple-600/pink-600)
3. Email Service Configuration
Update email templates in server/services/email.service.ts:
Change sender branding from "BuildAIde Team" to "ScriptTok Team"
Update email subject lines for ScriptTok context
Modify email HTML templates to reflect content creation/viral content themes
Update frontend URL references to ScriptTok domains
Keep the Gmail/Outlook configuration intact
4. Interface & Type Updates
Review server/interfaces/auth.interface.ts to ensure all types align with ScriptTok's user model
Verify phone number field is still needed for ScriptTok (may want email-only signup)
Ensure all auth response types match ScriptTok's expected data structure
5. Controller Logic Updates
In server/controllers/auth.controller.ts:
Update all console log prefixes from BuildAIde context to ScriptTok
Verify JWT secret environment variable names match ScriptTok's conventions
Ensure cookie settings align with ScriptTok's security requirements
Review OTP expiration times (currently 10 minutes) for ScriptTok's needs
6. Frontend Component Updates
Update all auth component copy in client/components/auth/:
signup.tsx: Change "Register Your Account" messaging to ScriptTok context
login.tsx: Update "Where Every Home Project Feels in Control" to viral content theme
forgot-password.tsx: Update "Lost Your Password? We've Got You" messaging
create-new-password.tsx: Keep security messaging but update branding
password-reset-success.tsx: Update success messaging
two-step-verification.tsx: Update verification flow copy
auth-layout.tsx: Complete overhaul of promotional visual content
7. Route & API Alignment
Verify server/routes/auth.routes.ts endpoint paths match ScriptTok's API structure
Ensure all /auth/* routes are namespaced appropriately for future integration
Keep test email endpoint for development purposes
8. Security & Environment Variables
Document all required environment variables in the README:
JWT_SECRET
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET
EMAIL_USER
EMAIL_PASSWORD
EMAIL_SERVICE
FRONTEND_URL
Add ScriptTok-specific security considerations
9. Mobile Responsiveness
Verify all auth forms work on mobile (already has some mobile styles)
Ensure ScriptTok branding displays correctly on smaller screens
Test that the auth layout promotional section hides properly on mobile
10. Documentation Updates
Update AuthForFutureIntegration/README.md:
Change all BuildAIde references to ScriptTok
Add specific ScriptTok integration notes
Document any ScriptTok-specific auth flows or requirements
List files ready for integration vs. files needing more work

server/services/email.service.ts - Email templates and branding
All client/components/auth/*.tsx files - Copy and messaging
server/controllers/auth.controller.ts - Logging and branding
AuthForFutureIntegration/README.md - Documentation

Prompt for Replit Agent:

Please update and restructure the legal and informational pages for the ScriptTok application to match current app standards and create a comprehensive legal compliance framework.

First, update these existing pages to reflect ScriptTok (not GlowBot) branding and functionality:

Update client/src/pages/CompliancePage.tsx:

Change all references from "GlowBot" to "ScriptTok"
Update the description to focus on TikTok content generation compliance
Remove Amazon Associates references since the app focuses on TikTok content creation
Update compliance disclosures to be TikTok-specific (#ad, #affiliate hashtags)
Update client/src/pages/how-it-works.tsx:

Completely rewrite to reflect ScriptTok's TikTok content generation workflow
Remove product research and Amazon integration references
Focus on: Select niche → Choose template → Generate TikTok content → Save to history
Update FAQ section to be ScriptTok-specific
Remove trend analysis features that don't exist in the current app
Update client/src/pages/faq.tsx:

Rewrite all FAQ content to be ScriptTok-specific
Remove references to Amazon integration, product research, trend detection
Focus on TikTok content generation, viral score analysis, content history features
Update contact information and support process
Update client/src/pages/contact.tsx:

Update branding from any GlowBot references to ScriptTok
Ensure contact form works with ScriptTok's support system
Update company information and social links if needed
Next, restructure and create these new legal/compliance pages:

Create client/src/pages/TermsBilling.tsx - "Terms & Billing" page:

Combine Terms of Service + Acceptable Use + Billing Terms
Cover: contract terms, usage rules, prohibited activities, subscription renewals, cancellations, refunds, arbitration, liability disclaimers
Include ScriptTok-specific acceptable use policies for AI-generated content
Add billing terms for subscription tiers and usage limits
Create client/src/pages/PrivacyCookies.tsx - "Privacy & Cookies" page:

Combine Privacy Policy + Data Rights + Cookie Policy
Cover: data collection from TikTok content generation, Claude AI usage, content storage
Include GDPR/CPRA rights (export/delete/correct data)
Detail how user-generated content and ratings are stored and used
Explain cookie usage for session management and preferences
Create client/src/pages/CookiePreferences.tsx - Cookie Preferences modal/page:

Functional cookie preferences management
Must be legally distinct and functional
Allow users to opt-out of non-essential cookies
Include "Do Not Sell/Share" options for CCPA compliance
Create client/src/pages/LegalNotices.tsx - "Legal Notices" page:

Combine DMCA + Security & Responsible Disclosure
Include copyright complaint process for AI-generated content

Update the Footer component (client/src/components/Footer.tsx):

Add all required legal page links:
Terms & Billing
Privacy & Cookies
Cookie Preferences (should trigger modal/separate page)
Legal Notices
Trust & Safety
Contact
Organize links in a professional footer layout
Ensure proper routing to all new pages
Update routing in the main App component to include all new legal pages with proper paths:

/terms-billing
/privacy-cookies
/cookie-preferences
/legal-notices
/trust-safety
Important guidelines:

All content should be ScriptTok-branded (no GlowBot references)
Focus on TikTok content generation as the primary app function
Include proper legal disclaimers for AI-generated content
Ensure GDPR, CCPA, and platform compliance
Make cookie preferences functional, not just informational
Use professional legal language but keep it user-friendly
Include proper contact information for legal matters

Remove any AboutThisPage components from individual pages as requested earlier - all information should be consolidated into the main About ScriptTok page.

Tools Section Redesign
TASK OVERVIEW
Redesign the Tools section of the ScriptTok application by creating 5 distinct tool tabs that match the structure and presentation style of Pictory's tool pages. DO NOT code anything yourself - carefully review the reference files first, then implement.

REQUIRED FIRST STEP
CAREFULLY REVIEW these three reference files to understand Pictory's tool page structure:

server/Pictory/Pictory Tools/Pictory Tool - AI Video Generator.html
server/Pictory/Pictory Tools/Tool - ChatGPT Video Generator.html
server/Pictory/Pictory Tools/Tool - Script To Video Creation In Minutes with Pictory.html
Study how Pictory structures each tool page: hero section, how-it-works steps, feature grids, visual demos, use cases, FAQs, and CTAs.

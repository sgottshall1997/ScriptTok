Replit Agent Test Prompt:

"I need you to thoroughly test the TrendForecaster component in my TikTok Viral Product Generator app. The TrendForecaster shows real-time TikTok trends powered by Perplexity AI across all 7 niches (beauty, tech, fashion, fitness, food, travel, pets).

What to test:

Initial Load: Navigate to the dashboard and verify the TrendForecaster component loads with all 7 niche tabs visible
Tab Switching: Click through each niche tab (beauty, tech, fashion, fitness, food, travel, pets) and confirm each loads trend data
Manual Refresh: Test the "Refresh" button on each niche to verify it fetches new data from Perplexity API
Trend Categories: For each niche, verify all 4 trend categories display correctly:
Hot (red styling with flame icon)
Rising (green styling with trending up icon)
Upcoming (blue styling with clock icon)
Avoid/Declining (gray styling with trending down icon)
Product Generation: Click the "Generate â†’" buttons on trend items to verify they navigate to the content generation page with the correct product and niche pre-filled
Data Freshness: Check that the "Last updated" timestamp updates when refreshing
Loading States: Verify loading spinners appear during data fetching
Error Handling: Test behavior when API calls fail or return empty data
Responsive Design: Test on different screen sizes to ensure the 7-tab grid layout works properly
Cache Behavior: Verify that trends are cached and don't auto-refresh (only manual refresh)
API Endpoints to verify:

/api/trend-forecast/:niche for each of the 7 niches
Confirm Perplexity API integration is working
Check that fallback data appears if API fails
Expected Behavior:

All 7 niches should load trend data successfully
Manual refresh should fetch fresh data from Perplexity (uses 1 API call per niche)
Trend items should be properly categorized and styled
Navigation to content generation should work seamlessly
Loading states and error handling should be smooth
Please test all functionality and report any issues with the TrendForecaster component, API responses, or user experience problems.

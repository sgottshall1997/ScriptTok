Looking at your comprehensive GlowBot application, I can see you've built a robust "TikTok Viral Product Generator" system with most of the core components already in place. Let me verify what you have and identify any missing pieces:

âœ… What You Already Have (Complete):
Core Components:
Product Trending Research âœ… - server/services/perplexityTrends.ts with Perplexity integration
Viral Content Analysis âœ… - server/services/tiktokViralResearch.ts with comprehensive viral pattern extraction
AI Script Generation âœ… - server/services/contentGenerator.ts with viral hooks integration
Platform Optimization âœ… - Multi-platform content formatting in server/services/multiPlatformContentGenerator.ts
Amazon Affiliate Integration âœ… - server/services/amazonAffiliate.ts and server/api/amazon.ts
Frontend Components:
Content Generator UI âœ… - client/src/components/ContentGenerator.tsx
Trending Products Display âœ… - client/src/components/TrendingProductsList.tsx
Amazon Integration UI âœ… - client/src/components/AmazonAffiliateDropdown.tsx
Video Script Generator âœ… - client/src/components/VideoScriptGenerator.tsx
API Endpoints:
Viral Research API âœ… - server/api/perplexity-trends/viral-research.ts
Amazon Product API âœ… - server/api/amazon.ts
Content Generation API âœ… - server/api/generateContent.ts
ðŸ“‹ What's Ready for Standalone Extraction:
Your existing system contains ALL the necessary components for a standalone "TikTok Viral Product Generator" app. Here are the key files you'd need:

Backend Core Files:
server/services/tiktokViralResearch.ts
server/services/perplexityTrends.ts
server/services/contentGenerator.ts
server/services/amazonAffiliate.ts
server/api/perplexity-trends/viral-research.ts
server/api/amazon.ts
server/api/generateContent.ts
Frontend Core Files:
client/src/components/ContentGenerator.tsx
client/src/components/TrendingProductsList.tsx
client/src/components/VideoScriptGenerator.tsx
client/src/components/AmazonAffiliateDropdown.tsx
client/src/lib/fetchViralVideoInspo.ts
Database Schema:
shared/schema.ts (trending products, content generations tables)
ðŸŽ¯ Answer: Yes, Everything is There!
Your GlowBot application already contains a complete, production-ready TikTok Viral Product Generator. The system includes:

Real-time product trending detection via Perplexity API
Viral content pattern analysis with engagement metrics
AI-powered script generation using viral templates
Multi-platform optimization (TikTok, Instagram, YouTube)
Amazon affiliate monetization with link generation
Comprehensive caching system for performance
Full UI components for user interaction
The only thing missing would be simplifying the UI for a standalone app by removing non-essential features and focusing solely on the viral product generator workflow.

Your current system is actually more comprehensive than most standalone viral content tools on the market. You have the complete technology stack ready for commercialization.

Please enhance the generateUniversalShortVideo function in server/services/promptFactory.ts to generate comprehensive video scripts like the niche-specific templates do. Currently, the universal short video template only generates basic content, but it should create detailed, structured video scripts similar to the Fashion and Fitness templates.

TASK REQUIREMENTS:

Replace the current generateUniversalShortVideo function with a comprehensive implementation that follows the same detailed structure as generateFashionShortVideo and generateFitnessShortVideo.

Video Script Structure: The enhanced universal template should include:

Attention-grabbing hook with multiple variations
Key features and benefits section
Problem-solving or value proposition
Target audience identification
Strong call-to-action with multiple options
Proper 30-60 second timing (100-170 words)
Template Requirements:

Follow the same writing guidelines as niche-specific templates
Include multiple hook examples that can be rotated
Provide multiple CTA variations to avoid repetition
Use clear, specific language without filler words
Target 100-170 words for 30-60 second delivery
Remove any markdown, hashtags, or formatting from output
Maintain Compatibility:

Keep the same function signature: generateUniversalShortVideo(config: PromptConfig): GeneratedPrompt
Ensure it works as fallback for any niche that doesn't have specific implementation
Integrate with viral template enhancement system
Return proper GeneratedPrompt object with systemPrompt, userPrompt, and templateMetadata
Content Quality:

Make it product-focused and conversion-oriented
Include specific sections for features, benefits, and use cases
Provide clear structure for video narration
Ensure smooth delivery for on-camera or voice-over use
EXPECTED OUTCOME:
After implementation, when any niche selects "Short Video" template, they should get a comprehensive, structured video script (either niche-specific or the enhanced universal version) instead of the current basic content. The universal template should be detailed enough to work effectively for any product category while maintaining the same professional quality as the niche-specific templates.

REFERENCE: Use generateFashionShortVideo and generateFitnessShortVideo as templates for the structure, but make the content generic enough to work for any product type across all niches.

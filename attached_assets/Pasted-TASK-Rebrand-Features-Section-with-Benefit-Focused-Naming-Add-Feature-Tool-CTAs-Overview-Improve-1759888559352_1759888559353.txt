TASK: Rebrand Features Section with Benefit-Focused Naming & Add Feature→Tool CTAs

Overview
Improve differentiation between Features and Tools sections by:

Renaming Features to be benefit-focused (not capability-focused)
Keeping Tools action-focused (already good)
Adding clear CTAs from Feature pages to corresponding Tool pages
Enhancing visual differentiation
Specific Changes Required
1. Rename Feature Pages (Benefit-Focused)
File: client/src/components/MarketingNav.tsx

In featuresData array, update these items:
"AI Script Generator" → "Instant Script Creation"
"Template Library" → "Proven Viral Templates"
Keep all other feature names as-is (they're already benefit-focused)
File: client/src/pages/features/AIScriptGeneratorFeature.tsx

Rename to: client/src/pages/features/InstantScriptCreationFeature.tsx
Update all internal references to match new name
Update route in routing configuration
File: client/src/pages/features/TemplateLibraryFeature.tsx

Rename to: client/src/pages/features/ProvenViralTemplatesFeature.tsx
Update all internal references to match new name
Update route in routing configuration
File: client/src/pages/features/index.tsx

Update exports to reflect new filenames
2. Add Feature→Tool CTAs
For EACH Feature page, add a final CTA section before the Footer that links to its corresponding Tool page:

Pattern to follow:

<section className="bg-gradient-to-r from-violet-50 to-purple-50 dark:from-violet-900/20 dark:to-purple-900/20 py-16 px-4">
  <div className="container mx-auto max-w-4xl text-center">
    <h2 className="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-bold mb-6">
      Ready to Get Hands-On?
    </h2>
    <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground mb-8">
      Explore the step-by-step guide and see exactly how to use this feature.
    </p>
    <Button
      onClick={() => navigate('/tools/[tool-name]')}
      size="lg"
      className="bg-violet-600 hover:bg-violet-700 text-white"
    >
      Try the [Tool Name] →
    </Button>
  </div>
</section>
Map Feature → Tool CTAs:

Instant Script Creation Feature → "Try the Script Generator →" (links to /tools/script-generator)
Proven Viral Templates Feature → "Try the Template Library →" (links to /tools/template-library)
Trend Discovery Feature → "Try Trend Discovery →" (links to /tools/trend-discovery)
Viral Score Feature → "Try the Viral Score Analyzer →" (links to /tools/viral-score)
Dual Studios Feature → "Try Both Studios →" (links to /dashboard)
Multi-Platform Feature → "Try Multi-Platform Optimization →" (links to /dashboard)
3. Visual Differentiation
Features Pages (Benefit-Focused):

Ensure FeatureHero uses purple gradient: bg-gradient-to-r from-purple-600 to-blue-600
Use purple accent colors throughout: text-purple-600, bg-purple-100
Copy should emphasize benefits and outcomes ("Save 10+ Hours Per Week", "3x Higher Engagement")
Tools Pages (How-To Focused):

Keep current utilitarian design with ToolHero
Use more neutral colors: grays, subtle accents
Copy should be instructional ("Step 1:", "How to use", "Getting Started")
4. Update All Routes
File: client/src/App.tsx or routing file

Update routes:
/features/ai-script-generator → /features/instant-script-creation
/features/template-library → /features/proven-viral-templates
File: client/src/components/MarketingNav.tsx

Update href properties in featuresData to match new routes
5. Update Internal Links
Search and replace across ALL files:

/features/ai-script-generator → /features/instant-script-creation
/features/template-library → /features/proven-viral-templates

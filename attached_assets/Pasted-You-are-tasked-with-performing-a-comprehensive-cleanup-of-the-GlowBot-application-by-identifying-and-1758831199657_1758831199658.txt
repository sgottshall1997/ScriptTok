You are tasked with performing a comprehensive cleanup of the GlowBot application by identifying and deleting all unused files. This includes code files, assets, and attached assets that are no longer referenced or needed in the current codebase.
OBJECTIVE: Analyze the entire project structure and permanently delete all files that are:
1. Not imported/required by any active code
2. Not referenced in any configuration files
3. Not used by the build process
4. Not serving any functional purpose in the application
SCOPE OF DELETION:
- Unused TypeScript/JavaScript files
- Unreferenced CSS files
- Unused images and assets
- Orphaned test files for deleted functionality
- Backup files (.backup.tsx, etc.)
- All files in /attached_assets/ directory
- Temporary files and logs
- Any other files not actively used by the application
ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:
1. Scan all import/require statements across the codebase
2. Check all file references in package.json, vite.config.ts, and other config files
3. Verify which files are actually served or used by the application
4. Identify dead code and unused components
5. Check for unused API endpoints and their corresponding files
EXCLUSIONS (DO NOT DELETE):
- Core configuration files (.replit, package.json, tsconfig.json, etc.)
- Essential build files (vite.config.ts, tailwind.config.ts, etc.)
- Database schema and migration files
- Environment files (.env, .env.example)
- README and documentation files that are current
- Any files actively used in the build process
ACTION PLAN:
1. First, create a comprehensive analysis report listing all files to be deleted with justification
2. Show the file deletion commands you will execute
3. Execute the deletions permanently (not just moving to trash)
4. Provide a final summary of space saved and files removed
CONSTRAINTS:
- Be thorough but cautious - double-check before deleting
- Ensure no critical functionality will be broken
- Focus on actual unused files, not just files that appear unused
- Delete the entire /attached_assets/ directory as requested
- Remove any backup or temporary files
Execute this cleanup operation and provide a detailed report of what was deleted and why.

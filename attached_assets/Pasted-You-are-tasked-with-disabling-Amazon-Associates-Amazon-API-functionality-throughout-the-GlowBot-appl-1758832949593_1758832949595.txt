You are tasked with disabling Amazon Associates/Amazon API functionality throughout the GlowBot application while preserving all the code for potential future re-enablement. This is a temporary deactivation, not a permanent deletion.
OBJECTIVE: Disable all Amazon Associates features by:
1. Commenting out or conditionally disabling Amazon-related functionality
2. Adding feature flags or environment checks to prevent execution
3. Updating UI components to hide Amazon-specific features
4. Preserving all existing code with clear disable markers
SCOPE OF CHANGES:
- Disable Amazon PA-API client and signing services
- Hide Amazon monetization settings in UI
- Disable affiliate link injection and generation
- Comment out Amazon product search and trending features
- Hide Amazon Associates disclosures
- Disable Amazon-specific scrapers and fetchers
- Update dashboard to hide Amazon sections
- Disable Amazon product picks panels
IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH:
1. Add environment variable checks (e.g., ENABLE_AMAZON_FEATURES=false)
2. Wrap Amazon functionality in conditional statements
3. Add // DISABLED: comments to clearly mark disabled sections
4. Update UI components to conditionally render Amazon features
5. Disable API endpoints while keeping route definitions
6. Comment out Amazon-related imports but keep them for reference
KEY FILES TO MODIFY (disable, don't delete):
- server/services/amazon/* (disable clients and services)
- server/services/affiliateLinkInjector.ts (disable injection logic)
- server/services/amazonAffiliate.ts (disable affiliate functions)
- server/scrapers/amazon*.ts (disable scrapers)
- client/src/components/monetization/* (hide UI components)
- client/src/components/AmazonAssociatesDisclosure.tsx (hide component)
- client/src/pages/AffiliateLinks.tsx (hide or show disabled state)
- server/api routes that handle Amazon functionality
- Dashboard Amazon sections
EXAMPLE PATTERN FOR DISABLING:
```javascript
// DISABLED: Amazon Associates functionality temporarily disabled
const ENABLE_AMAZON_FEATURES = process.env.ENABLE_AMAZON_FEATURES === 'true';
if (!ENABLE_AMAZON_FEATURES) {
  return { disabled: true, message: 'Amazon features temporarily disabled' };
}
// ... existing Amazon code here
REQUIREMENTS:

Preserve ALL existing Amazon-related code
Add clear "DISABLED:" comments explaining the temporary nature
Ensure the app runs normally without Amazon features
Keep all imports and dependencies intact
Add environment variable ENABLE_AMAZON_FEATURES=false to disable
Update UI to show "temporarily disabled" messages where appropriate
Ensure no broken functionality or missing components
Execute this systematic disabling of Amazon Associates features while keeping all code intact for future re-enablement.

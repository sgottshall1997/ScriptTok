Please update the About page (client/src/pages/about.tsx) and Landing page (client/src/pages/LandingPage.tsx) to clearly explain and showcase ScriptTok's two distinct content generation studios:

Viral Content Studio - Creates trend-based viral content without requiring specific products (uses viral templates like viral_hooks, viral_short_script, viral_storytime, etc.)
Affiliate Content Studio - Creates product-focused content with affiliate integration (uses affiliate templates like affiliate_email, influencer_caption, product_comparison, etc.)
Specific changes needed:

For the About Page:

Update the main description to explain both content studios as separate but complementary tools
In the "What ScriptTok Does" section, clearly differentiate between viral content creation and affiliate content creation
Update the "How to Use ScriptTok" workflow to show the choice between the two studios
In the content template types section, clearly separate and label the templates by their respective studios (Viral vs Affiliate)
Update any examples or use cases to show both viral and affiliate content scenarios
For the Landing Page:

Update the hero section to mention both content generation modes
In the "How ScriptTok Works" section, show that users first choose between Viral or Affiliate Content Studio
Update the step-by-step process to reflect the choice between viral trending topics vs affiliate product selection
Ensure the product demo section shows both pathways clearly
Update any CTAs or feature descriptions to encompass both content types
Key messaging to incorporate:

Viral Content Studio: Perfect for creators who want to ride trending topics and create engaging content without promoting specific products
Affiliate Content Studio: Ideal for affiliate marketers and influencers who want to create compelling product-focused content with affiliate links
Both studios use the same AI intelligence but optimize for different goals (viral engagement vs product conversion)
Technical requirements:

Maintain all existing functionality and styling
Keep the current component structure intact
Ensure all links and navigation remain functional
Update any hardcoded references that assume only affiliate content generation
Make sure the language is clear and distinguishes between the two modes without confusion
Please make these updates comprehensively across both pages, ensuring the messaging is consistent and the user understands they have two powerful content creation options depending on their goals.

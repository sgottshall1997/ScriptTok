Prompt for Replit Agent:

Please completely overhaul the About ScriptTok page (client/src/pages/about.tsx) to provide a comprehensive overview of the ScriptTok application. The current page has outdated references to "GlowBot" and doesn't accurately reflect what ScriptTok actually does.

Requirements for the new About ScriptTok page:

Update the main header and branding to properly reflect ScriptTok as a TikTok content generation platform
Create a clear application overview explaining that ScriptTok is specifically designed for TikTok content creation and viral content generation
Add a features section highlighting the key capabilities:
TikTok Generator for viral content creation
Content History with rating and sorting capabilities
AI-powered viral score analysis
Multiple content templates and niches
Trending product integration
Include a "How ScriptTok Works" section with a step-by-step workflow:
Choose your niche (beauty, fitness, tech, etc.)
Select content templates optimized for TikTok
Generate viral-ready captions and scripts
Review and save to content history
Add a supported niches section listing all available content categories
Update the navigation grid to reflect the actual pages in the app (Dashboard, TikTok Generator, Content History, Account, etc.)
Remove all references to product research, Amazon integration, and features that don't exist in ScriptTok
Update the "Getting Started" section to guide users through the actual ScriptTok workflow
Fix all broken links and ensure navigation points to real pages in the application
Remove or update the search functionality to work with the actual ScriptTok features
Additionally, please remove all AboutThisPage components from the bottom of these individual pages:

client/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx
client/src/pages/GenerateContent.tsx
client/src/pages/EnhancedContentHistory.tsx
client/src/pages/contact.tsx
client/src/pages/faq.tsx
client/src/pages/how-it-works.tsx
client/src/pages/privacy.tsx
client/src/pages/terms.tsx
client/src/pages/not-found.tsx
client/src/pages/CompliancePage.tsx
Simply remove the entire AboutThisPage component and its related logic from each of these files. All relevant information should be consolidated into the main About ScriptTok page instead.

Important: Make sure the new About page is accurate to what ScriptTok actually does - it's a TikTok content generation tool, not a comprehensive product research platform. Focus on the content creation workflow and viral optimization features that actually exist in the application.

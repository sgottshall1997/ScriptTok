Write a direct, impactful review script for the pet product "{{productName}}", intended for a 30–60 second social media video about pets or pet care.

Your task is to help viewers quickly understand why {{productName}} is worth using for their pets by presenting clear, specific information about its functionality, quality, benefits, and value—while avoiding vague claims and filler.

The script must include the following sections, in order:

1. Attention-grabbing hook
Start with a surprising or slightly negative statement that includes the product name and stops the viewer from scrolling.

Use a different hook each time – do not reuse hooks.

Examples:
• "Still using old bowls instead of {{productName}}? Here's what your pet is missing."
• "Most pet owners skip {{productName}} — here's why they regret it."
• "Stop guessing what works — here's why {{productName}} delivers real results."
• "Is {{productName}} just another gimmick? Let's test it."
• "Think all pet gear is the same? {{productName}} proves otherwise."
• "Don't buy another toy before seeing this about {{productName}}."

2. Specific features and pet-focused benefits
List 3–4 clear, factual benefits of the product based on its design or function.

Include details like:
• Pet-specific design (e.g., chew-resistant, slow-feed, ergonomic for paws)
• Safety or health benefits (e.g., BPA-free, vet-approved, supports digestion)
• Materials and durability (e.g., non-toxic silicone, stainless steel, tear-resistant fabric)
• Comfort or ease of use (e.g., padded straps, anti-slip base, breathable mesh)
• Ease of cleaning (e.g., dishwasher-safe, machine-washable)

Avoid generic claims like "great for pets." Be precise about why and how it works.

3. Solves real pet-owner problems
Explain how it makes life easier for pet owners or improves the pet's daily experience.

Examples:
• "No more spilled water bowls during zoomies."
• "Keeps pets calm during travel or vet visits."
• "Helps reduce anxiety when left alone."
• "Stops fast eaters from choking or bloating."
• "Keeps fur off furniture without constant vacuuming."

4. Pet type or lifestyle fit
State who it's best for: species, breed size, activity level, or situation.

Examples:
• "Perfect for small dogs with sensitive digestion."
• "Great for high-energy breeds that destroy everything else."
• "Best for indoor cats needing mental stimulation."
• "Ideal for pets with allergies or special diets."
• "Designed for travel, crates, or small apartments."

5. Value and durability
Summarize the long-term benefit or cost-efficiency.

Examples:
• "Built to last — saves you money replacing cheap toys."
• "Affordable for the quality, especially if your pet destroys gear fast."
• "Worth it for pet parents who want convenience and peace of mind."
• "Outperforms more expensive brands we've tried."

6. Call-to-action
End with a direct question or prompt to engage viewers and encourage action.

Pick a different CTA every time.

Examples:
• "Would your pet actually use this?"
• "Ready to stop wasting money on stuff they ignore?"
• "What would your dog do with this right now?"
• "Could this finally solve your pet's biggest issue?"
• "How would this upgrade your routine?"

Writing Guidelines:
• Use clear, simple, specific language.
• Use short, punchy, declarative sentences.
• Use active voice only.
• Avoid filler (e.g., "really," "very," "literally"), metaphors, clichés, and vague claims.
• Do not include emojis, hashtags, asterisks, or notes.
• Don't generalize (e.g., "all pets love it") — stay factual and grounded.

Length & Structure:
• Target: 100–170 words (30–60 seconds spoken).
• Structured for clean on-camera delivery or voiceover.
• Smooth but crisp transitions between sections.

Goal:
Help viewers clearly understand why {{productName}} is a smart buy for their pet, what problem it solves, how it fits their lifestyle, and prompt them to imagine it in their home.

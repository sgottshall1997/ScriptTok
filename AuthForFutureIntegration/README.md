# Authentication Code - Ready for Future Integration

This folder contains all authentication-related code from the New BuildAIde migration, preserved for future integration.

## Contents

### Backend (`/server`)
- **Controllers**: `auth.controller.ts` - Handles auth endpoints (signup, login, logout, session management)
- **Routes**: `auth.routes.ts` - Express routes for authentication
- **Services**: `email.service.ts` - Email service for verification and password resets
- **Interfaces**: `auth.interface.ts` - TypeScript interfaces for auth types

### Frontend (`/client`)
- **Components**: Complete auth component library including:
  - Login forms
  - Signup forms  
  - Password reset flows
  - Session management

## Integration Instructions

When ready to integrate authentication:

1. Copy backend files to `server/src/` in their respective directories
2. Import and register auth routes in `server/src/routes/index.ts`
3. Copy frontend components to `client/src/components/auth/`
4. Update `client/src/App.tsx` with auth-protected routes
5. Configure environment variables for email service

## Notes
- Auth was intentionally excluded from initial migration per requirements
- Code is production-ready from New BuildAIde
- Uses Replit Auth integration patterns
